# Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms - Assignment 2

This is the second assignment for Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms YSC2229. This problem set focuses on Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues.

## Overview

- **Total Questions:** 17
  - **Linked Lists:** 5 questions
  - **Arrays:** 5 questions
  - **Stacks:** 5 questions
  - **Queues:** 2 questions

## Recommended Sequence

### Arrays

1. `two_sum.py`
2. `triplet_sum.py`
3. `quadruple_sum.py`
4. `conflicting_appointments.py`
5. `dutch_flag.py`

### Linked Lists

1. `linked_list_has_cycle.py`
2. `linked_list_middle_element.py`
3. `linked_list_palindrome.py`
4. `linked_list_reverse_sublist.py`
5. `linked_list_reverse_every_k_sublist.py`

### Stacks

1. `daily_temperatures.py`
2. `remove_duplicate_letters.py`
3. `remove_duplicate_elements_2.py`
4. `smallest_number_removing_k_digits.py`
5. `maximum_width_ramp.py`

### Queues

1. `longest_continuous_subarray.py`
2. `continuous_subarrays.py`

This sequence is just a suggestion. You can solve the problems in any order you like. However, this sequence guides you to solve problems that build on top of one another.

## Getting Help

- **Discussion Post:** If you have general questions about the problems, please post them in the discussion post.
- **Errors / Bugs / Private Queries:** If you find any errors or bugs in the problem set, please telegram a message to @yokurang or email @alan.matthew@u.yale-nus.edu.sg. Furthermore, if you have any urgent or private queries about the problem set or setting up the assignment on your computer, please telegram or email me.

## Testing

Like last time, you can test your code by running ```pytest```. You can find the test files in the `tests` folder. For example, to test your code for `two_sum.py`, you can run the following command:

```bash
pytest tests/test_two_sum.py
```

Furthermore, there are no hidden unit tests for this assignment. If you see a green checkmark after pushing your solutions, you will receive a perfect score. However, your code will be tested for plagiarism using the Stanford MOSS software.

## Submission

Like last time, to start the assignment, please click the assignment link and accept the assignment. This will create a private repository for you to work on the assignment. You can find the assignment link in the assignment description on Canvas. 

To submit your assignment, please push your code to the repository. You can push your code as many times as you like. The last commit before the deadline will be graded. The deadline for this assignment is **September 19 2023, 23:59 SGT**.

## Final Note

All questions in this problem set can be solved using only array, linked list, stacks, and queues concepts. You do not need to use any other data structures or algorithms, for instance a hashmap. If you find yourself using other data structures or algorithms, you are probably overthinking the problem.
